Note:
Tkinter uses text units for width and height measurements, instead of something like inches, 
centimeters, or pixels, to ensure consistent behavior of the application across platforms.
Measuring units by the width of a character means that the size of a widget is relative to
the default font on a userâ€™s machine. This ensures the text fits properly in labels and buttons,
no matter where the application is running.
